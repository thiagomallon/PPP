## PPP (Principles, Patterns and Proposals)
#### SOLID principles, Design Patterns and PSR's proposals (and tests by using TDD and BDD approuch)

**This project is under development** 

**Everything is being implemented by using SOLID principles, GOF patterns, FIG proposals (PSR's), TDD and BDD approach**

The objective is to implement something simple, but useful and respecting the conventions. I'm using **bower** and **composer** to manage package and dependencies, respectively. **PSR-1** and **PSR-2** for code conventions and style, **PSR-3** for logger interface and **PSR-4** for autoload. There is some samples of using stream, stream wrapper for session and data storage and to test http requisitions. All the code was tested using **TDD** approach and **PHPUnit Framework**. JS script was tested too, by using **Jasmine Framework**. Project code has been documented by using **phpDocumentor**.

**Composer**
