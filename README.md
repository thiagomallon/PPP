## PPP (Principles, Patterns and Proposals)
#### S.O.L.I.D. principles, Design Patterns and PSR's proposals

**This project is under development** 

**Everything is being implemented by using SOLID principles, Design Patterns, FIG proposals (PSR's), TDD and BDD approach**
T
he objective is to implement something simple, but useful and respecting the conventions. I'm using **bower** and **composer** to manage package and dependencies, respectively. **PSR-1** and **PSR-2** for code conventions and style, **PSR-3** for logger interface and **PSR-4** for autoloading. I'm using stream wrappers for session storage, temporary data storage and to test http requisitions. All of the code is being developed by following the **TDD** approach with **PHPUnit Framework**. JS script was tested too, by using **Jasmine Framework**. Project code is being documented by using **phpDocumentor**.

**Composer**
